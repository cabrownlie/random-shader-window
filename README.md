# Random Shader Window

This project is a playground for learning how to use the WebGPU Shading Language (WGSL). It sets up a window and a basic render pipeline using the `wgpu` and `winit` crates, and then applies a random shader to the window.

## Features

- Window setup using `winit`
- Basic render pipeline setup using `wgpu`
- Random shader application

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

## Note
This project is primarily for learning purposes and is not intended to be a fully-featured application. The render pipeline setup is kept as simple as possible to focus on the shader functionality. Future improvements may include tweaking the render pipeline setup to ensure compatibility with other platforms.

## Dependencies
- Rust
- wgpu
- winit
 -tokio

## Contributing
This project is just a personal learning playground, but if you're interested in WGSL and want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request or issue.
